# LUKSO Docs Contribution Guide

Welcome to our documentation guide for contributors. We've set up specific rules and conventions to make PR reviews more seamless and have a global way of documenting and styling things.

## Naming Conventions

- We write `true`/`false` in code brackets and **lowercase** without additional styling to ensure it is a boolean, not a value or constant.
- We always refer to [ERC725Y keys]() as _data keys_, so there is no confusion for readers about keys in general, for instance, controller keys, public/private keys, etc.
- We only use bold text for keywords or phrases instead of whole sentences, as it should only highlight the most critical information.
- We use _simple present_ tense and _3rd person singular_ to describe functions and document APIs / ABIs.
- We use _simple present_ in headings but do not enrich them with additional styling.
- We use _Universal Profile_ instead of _account_ or _profile_.
- We use _Transaction Relay Service_ instead of _transaction relayer_ or _relayer_.
- We use either _controller_ or _private key_ instead of _controller key_.

## Word Specification

The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT", "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this repository are to be interpreted as described in [RFC 2119](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc2119).

## Content Styling

- We try to keep a unified look for the headings on the right navigation bar and, therefore, encourage the use of _less than_ 35 characters so they do not split up into several rows.
- We do not skip headline sizes. The use of `##` should only be done if at least one parent headline uses only one hash sign.
- We always write parameter names in _code brackets_. If there is an additional code snippet, the naming of the parameters should be equal.
- We only use one text styling at a time and neither stack bold, italic, heading, or code formation on top of each other. Links, however, do not count as styling and can always be added.
- We try to stick to Markdown as much as possible. We make exceptions for
  - media integrations other than pictures
  - tables bigger than 120 chars in line length
  - custom styling out of regular page content
- We encourage the use of [Docusaurus Admonitions](https://docusaurus.io/docs/markdown-features/admonitions) for
  - additional information,
  - warnings, or
  - hints.
- We encourage the use of [Docusaurus Tabs](https://docusaurus.io/docs/markdown-features/tabs) if there are different
  - versions for code snippets or files,
  - outcomes regarding code execution, or
  - additional code explanations, unnecessary for the immediate implementation.

## Page Headers

- Every markdown file should have a `description` set within the [Docusaurus Head Metadata](https://docusaurus.io/docs/markdown-features/head-metadata) to deliver improved descriptions within search engine entries.
- Every documentation page must come with the [Docusaurus Markdown Header's](https://v1.docusaurus.io/docs/en/doc-markdown#markdown-headers) properties `sidebar_position` and `sidebar_label` to determine a strict order and title for the content.

## File Links

- Internal pages within the [`docs`](./docs/) folder are referenced using relative redirections that end with `.md`. This way, link correctness can be checked within the build process of the webpage and is not affected by sidebar restructures.
- Global pages within the [`src/pages`](./src/pages/) folder are referenced as relative link without file ending.

> Upon merging, rearranging, or removing pages, a reference must be created in the _redirects register_ of the [`docusaurus.config.js`](./docusaurus.config.js) file. This way, SEO entries can be updated and links will automatically redirect users to the new page.

## LSP Naming

- We always write standard names beginning with an uppercase letter to distinguish them from regular descriptions.
- We use the _full standard name with a hyphen and spaces_ between the abbreviation and the long-written words for headings.
- We always use the _full standard name_ without any additional characters for explanations within the text. The abbreviation should _only_ be excluded if the _full standard name_ was mentioned at least once on the _same_ page before.
- We use the _full standard name without any spaces_ to address the _underlying smart contract_ directly

## Examples

### Name Conventions

The function retrieves an array of _data keys_ for **multiple** smart contract addresses if the read-in result of the last call returned `true.` Otherwise, the function will return `false` as the given addresses do not appear to be [LSP0 ERC725 Accounts](./docs/standards/universal-profile/lsp0-erc725account.md).

### Page Metadata

```markdown
---
sidebar_label: 'Feature Requests'
sidebar_position: 3
description: 'LUKSO ecosystem feature requests: developer events, hackathons, grants.'
---
```

### Page Links

[Global Page](`./install-up-browser-extension`)
[Internal Documentation Page](`../standards/indroduction.md`)
```
