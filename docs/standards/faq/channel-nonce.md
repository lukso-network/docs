# What are multi-channel nonces?

This concept was taken from [Out of order execution](https://github.com/amxx/permit#out-of-order-execution).

Using nonces prevent old signed transactions from being replayed again (replay attacks). A nonce is an arbitrary number that can be used just once in a transaction.

### Problem of Sequential Nonces

With native transactions, nonces are strictly sequential. This means that messages with sequential nonces must be executed in order. For instance, in order for message number 4 to be executed, it must wait for message number 3 to complete.

However, **sequential nonces come with the following limitation**:

Some users may want to sign multiple message, allowing the transfer of different assets to different recipients. In that case, the recipient want to be able to use / transfer their assets whenever they want, and will certainly not want to wait on anyone before signing another transaction.

 This is where **out-of-order execution** comes in.

### Introducing multi-channel nonces

Out-of-order execution is achieved by using multiple independent channels. Each channel's nonce behaves as expected, but different channels are independent. This means that messages 2, 3, and 4 of `channel 0` must be executed sequentially, but message 3 of channel 1 is independent, and only depends on message 2 of `channel 1`.

The benefit is that the signer key can determine for which channel to sign the nonces. Relay services will have to understand the channel the signer choose and execute the transactions of each channel in the right order, to prevent failing transactions.

### Nonces in the KeyManager

The Key Manager allows out-of-order execution of messages by using nonces through multiple channels.

 Nonces are represented as `uint256` from the concatenation of two `uint128` : the `channelId` and the `nonceId`.

 - left most 128 bits : `channelId`
 - right most 128 bits: `nonceId`

</p>


The current nonce can be queried using:

```solidity
function getNonce(address _address, uint256 _channel) public view returns (uint256)
```
Since the `channelId` represents the left-most 128 bits, using a minimal value like 1 will return a huge `nonce` number: `2**128` equal to 3402823669209384634633746074317682114**56**.

After the signed transaction is executed the `nonceId` will be incremented by 1, this will increment the `nonce` by 1 as well because the nonceId represents the first 128 bits of the nonce so it will be 3402823669209384634633746074317682114**57**.

```solidity

_nonces[signer][nonce >> 128]++

```
`nonce >> 128` represents the channel which the signer chose for executing the transaction. After looking up the nonce of the signer at that specific channel it will be incremented by 1 `++`.

For sequential messages, users could use channel `0` and for out-of-order messages they could use channel `n`.

**Important:** It's up to the user to choose the channel that he wants to sign multiple sequential orders on it, not necessary `0`.
