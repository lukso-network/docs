# LSP0ERC725Account

:::info Solidity contract

[`LSP0ERC725Account.sol`](https://github.com/lukso-network/lsp-smart-contracts/blob/main/contracts/LSP0ERC725Account/LSP0ERC725AccountCore.sol)

:::

The **LSP0ERC725Account** contract is an implementation for the **[LSP0-ERC725Account Standard](../universal-profile/lsp0-erc725account)**. This contract forms a **Universal Profile** when combined with **[LSP3-UniversalProfile-Metadata Standard](https://github.com/lukso-network/LIPs/blob/main/LSPs/LSP-3-UniversalProfile-Metadata.md)**.

This contract could be used as a _blockchain-based account_ by humans, machines, organizations, or even other smart contracts. It has all the basic functionalities of an _Externally Owned Account_ (EOA), as well as the following functions that give the contract additional features:

- [`execute(...)`](#execute) : enables to execute functions on other contracts, transfer value, or deploy new contracts.
- [`isValidSignature(...)`](#isvalidsignature): delivers verification of signatures and signed messages from EOAs.
- [`universalReceiver(...)`](#universalreceiver): brings notification of incoming calls and assets.
- [`setData(...)`](#setdata): offers to set information in the account storage.

:::note
LSP0ERC725Account contract also contains the method from [ERC165](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-165):

```solidity
function supportsInterface(bytes4 interfaceId) public view returns (bool)
```

## Functions

### constructor

```solidity
constructor(address initialOwner)
```

Sets the **initial owner** of the contract.

#### Parameters:

| Name           | Type    | Description                                      |
| :------------- | :------ | :----------------------------------------------- |
| `initialOwner` | address | The address to set as the owner of the contract. |

### owner

```solidity
function owner() public view returns (address owner)
```

Returns the address of the current owner of the contract.

#### Return Values:

| Name    | Type    | Description                        |
| :------ | :------ | :--------------------------------- |
| `owner` | address | The current owner of the contract. |

### pendingOwner

```solidity
function pendingOwner() public view returns (address)
```

Return the address of the pending owner that was initiated by [`transferOwnership(address)`](#transferownership).

> **NB:** if no ownership transfer is in progress, the `pendingOwner` MUST be `address(0)`.

#### Return Values:

| Name           | Type    | Description                      |
| :------------- | :------ | :------------------------------- |
| `pendingOwner` | address | The address of the pending owner |

### transferOwnership

```solidity
function transferOwnership(address newOwner) public
```

Initiate an ownership transfer by setting the `newOwner` as `pendingOwner`.

Requirements:

- Can only be called by the current owner.
- The `newOwner` to be set as the `pendingOwner` cannot be `address(this)`.

#### Parameters:

| Name       | Type    | Description                           |
| :--------- | :------ | :------------------------------------ |
| `newOwner` | address | The address to set as `pendingOwner`. |

### acceptOwnership

```solidity
function acceptOwnership() public
```

Transfers ownership of the contract to the `pendingOwner` address. Can only be called by the `pendingOwner`.

_Triggers the **[OwnershipTransferred](#ownershiptransferred)** event once the new owner has claimed ownership._

### renounceOwnership

```solidity
function renounceOwnership() public
```

Since renouncing ownership is a sensitive operation, it is done as a two-step process by calling `renounceOwnership(..)` twice. First to initiate the process, second as a confirmation.

The current block number is saved as a part of initiation because the following behaviour is wanted:

- The first 100 blocks after the saved block is the pending period, if you call `renounceOwnership(..)` during this period, the transaction will be reverted.
- the following 100 blocks is the period when you can confirm the renouncement of the contract by calling `renounceOwnership(..)` the second time.

_Triggers the **[RenounceOwnershipInitiated](#renounceownershipinitiated)** event in the first call._

_Triggers the **[OwnershipTransferred](#ownershiptransferred)** event after successfully renouncing ownership._

:::warning
Leaves the contract without an owner. Once ownership of the contract is renounced, it won't be possible to call the functions restricted to the owner only.
:::

### fallback

```solidity
fallback() external payable
```

Executed when value is transferred to the contract or when function identifier doesn't match any of the available functions.

_Triggers the **[ValueReceived](#valuereceived)** event when a native token is received._

### execute

```solidity
function execute(
    uint256 operationType,
    address to,
    uint256 value,
    bytes memory data
) public payable returns (bytes memory result)
```

Executes a call on any other smart contracts, transfers value, or deploys a new smart contract.

The `operationType` can be the following:

- `0` for `CALL`
- `1` for `CREATE`
- `2` for `CREATE2`
- `3` for `STATICCALL`
- `4` for `DELEGATECALL`

_Triggers the **[Executed](#executed)** event when a call is successfully executed using `CALL/STATICCALL/DELEGATECALL` operations._

_Triggers the **[ContractCreated](#contractcreated)** event when a smart contract is created using `CREATE/CREATE2` operations._

:::note
The `execute(...)` function can only be called by the current owner of the contract.

The operation types `staticcall` (`3`) and `delegatecall` (`4`) do not allow to transfer value.
:::

#### Parameters:

| Name            | Type    | Description                                                                                                              |

Forwards the call to the **UniversalReceiverDelegate** contract if its address is stored at the [LSP1UniversalReceiverDelegate](../generic-standards/lsp1-universal-receiver.md#extension) data Key. The contract being called is expected to be an **[LSP1UniversalReceiverDelegateUP](./lsp1-universal-receiver-delegate-up.md)**, supporting [LSP1UniversalReceiverDelegate InterfaceId](./interface-ids.md) using [ERC165](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-165).

### isValidSignature

```solidity
function isValidSignature(

```

Checks if a signature was signed by the `owner` of the contract, according to [EIP-1271](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-1271). If the `owner` is a contract itself, it will call the `isValidsignature(..)` function on the owner contract, if it supports [EIP-1271](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-1271). Otherwise it will return the failure value.

#### Parameters:
