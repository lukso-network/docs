# LSP1UniversalReceiverDelegateVault

The **LSP1UniversalReceiverDelegateVault** is the contract called by the **[universalReceiver](./lsp9-vault.md#universalreceiver)** function of the **[LSP9Vault](./lsp9-vault.md)** contract that:
It writes the **[LSP7-DigitalAsset](../nft-2.0/03-LSP7-Digital-Asset.md)** and **[LSP8-IdentifiableDigitalAsset](../nft-2.0/04-LSP8-Identifiable-Digital-Asset.md)** assets a vault receives into the vault storage, and remove them on zero balance according to the **[LSP5-ReceivedAssets standard](https://github.com/lukso-network/LIPs/blob/main/LSPs/LSP-5-ReceivedAssets.md)**.  

:::note
**_LSP1UniversalReceiverDelegateVault contract also contains the methods from_ [_ERC165_](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-165) :**

- **supportsInterface (bytes4 interfaceId) public view  returns (bool)**
:::

## Functions

### constructor

```solidity
  constructor()
```

Registers **[LSP1UniversalReceiverDelegate InterfaceId](./interface-ids.md)**.

### universalReceiverDelegate

```solidity
  function universalReceiverDelegate(
    address sender,
    bytes32 typeId,
    bytes memory data
  ) public payable returns (bytes memory result)
```

Writes the received **LSP7DigitalAsset**, **LSP8IdentifiableDigitalAsset** assets into the vault storage according to the **LSP5ReceivedAssets** Standards. 

The keys representing an **asset** are cleared when the asset is not owned by the vault anymore.
