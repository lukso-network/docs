# The LUKSO Standard Proposals (LSPs)

:::success Implementation

See the [Contracts Implementation](./smart-contracts/introduction.md) section for the Solidity implementation of these standards.

:::

The **LUKSO Standards Proposals (LSPs)** represent the **main building blocks** of the LUKSO ecosystem. People, groups, and organizations can use them to build blockchain-based applications that aim to maximize the user experience, allow more flexibility and interaction, and open doors to hundreds of ideas.

The **[default implementation](./smart-contracts/introduction.md)** of these standards in Solidity is available as Open Source Software under the [LUKSO GitHub repository](https://github.com/lukso-network). They can be used as a base by developers to build their applications.

## Introduction

The current **blockchain experience** comes with many limitations, not necessarily because of the complexity but because of the broken infrastructure represented by the old underlying tools and standards used to operate on the network.

Change should start from the bottom to create a better user experience on the blockchain, starting from the fundamental pieces to propagating to the top. Topics related to **identity**, **assets representation**, and **smart contract interaction** require standardization. Such standards should be flexible enough to support and allow more potential use-cases in the future.

The following documentation describes the fundamentals of the standards and technical aspects of the LUKSO ecosystem.

## LSPs Foundation

This section lists and describes the first ten Standards representing the foundation of **LUKSO's ecosystem**.

They introduce new concepts like **blockchain-based accounts** (also known as **Universal Profiles**), **Digital Assets, and NFT 2.0**.

:::note
The standards are **order-independent** and could be related to a **backward or forward** order.
