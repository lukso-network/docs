# LSP9Vault

:::info Solidity contract

[`LSP9Vault.sol`](https://github.com/lukso-network/lsp-smart-contracts/blob/main/contracts/LSP9Vault/LSP9Vault.sol)

:::

The **LSP9Vault** contract is an implementation of the **[LSP9-Vault Standard](#)**.

This contract can be used as a **vault** that can **hold assets** and **interact with other smart contracts**, as it has all the functions of the **[LSP0ERC725Account](./lsp0-erc725-account.md)** contract, except for the **`isValidSignature(...)`** function.

:::note
_LSP9Vault contract also contains the methods from the [ERC165 Standard](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-165):_

```solidity
function supportsInterface(bytes4 interfaceId) public view returns (bool)
```

:::

---

## Functions

### constructor

```solidity
constructor(address initialOwner)
```

Sets the **initial owner** of the contract, the **[SupportedStandards:LSP9Vault ](#)** data key in the vault storage.

If the `initialOwner` is an **[LSP0ERC725Account](./lsp0-erc725-account.md)** contract, the **[`universalReceiver(...)`](./lsp0-erc725-account.md#universalreceiver)** function will be called on the **LSP0ERC725Account** contract to inform the account about the **newly owned vault**.

#### Parameters:

| Name           | Type      | Description                                      |
| :------------- | :-------- | :----------------------------------------------- |
| `initialOwner` | `address` | The address to set as the owner of the contract. |

### owner

```solidity
function owner() public view returns (address owner)
```

Returns the address of the current vault owner.

#### Return Values:

| Name    | Type      | Description                     |
| :------ | :-------- | :------------------------------ |
| `owner` | `address` | The current owner of the vault. |

### pendingOwner

```solidity
function pendingOwner() public view returns (address)
```

Return the address of the pending owner that was initiated by [`transferOwnership(address)`](#transferownership).

> **NB:** if no ownership transfer is in progress, the `pendingOwner` MUST be `address(0)`.

#### Return Values:

| Name           | Type      | Description                      |
| :------------- | :-------- | :------------------------------- |
| `pendingOwner` | `address` | The address of the pending owner |

### transferOwnership

```solidity
function transferOwnership(address newOwner) public
```

Initiate an ownership transfer by setting the `newOwner` as `pendingOwner`.

Requirements:

- Can only be called by the current owner.
- The `newOwner` to be set as the `pendingOwner` cannot be `address(this)`.

#### Parameters:

| Name       | Type      | Description                           |
| :--------- | :-------- | :------------------------------------ |
| `newOwner` | `address` | The address to set as `pendingOwner`. |

### acceptOwnership

```solidity
function acceptOwnership() public
```

Transfers ownership of the contract to the `pendingOwner` address. Can only be called by the `pendingOwner`.

_Triggers the **[OwnershipTransferred](#ownershiptransferred)** event once the new owner has claimed ownership._

### renounceOwnership

```solidity
function renounceOwnership() public
```

Since renouncing ownership is a sensitive operation, it is done as a two step process by calling `renounceOwnership(..)` twice. First to initiate the process, second as a confirmation.

The current block number is saved as a part of initiation because the following behaviour is wanted:

- The first 100 blocks after the saved block is the pending period, if you call `renounceOwnership(..)` during this period, the transaction will be reverted.
- the following 100 blocks is the period when you can confirm the renouncement of the contract by calling `renounceOwnership(..)` the second time.

_Triggers the **[RenounceOwnershipInitiated](#renounceownershipinitiated)** event in the first call._

_Triggers the **[OwnershipTransferred](#ownershiptransferred)** event after successfully renouncing ownership._

:::warning
Leaves the contract without an owner. Once ownership of the contract is renounced, it won't be possible to call the functions restricted to the owner only.
:::

### fallback

```solidity
fallback() external payable
```

Executed when value is transferred to the contract or when function identifier doesn't match any of the available functions.

_Triggers the **[ValueReceived](#valuereceived)** event when a native token is received._

### execute

```solidity
function execute(
    uint256 operationType,
    address target,
    uint256 value,
    bytes memory data
) public payable returns (bytes memory result)
```

Executes a call on any other smart contracts, transfers value, or deploys a new smart contract.

The following `operationType` MUST exist:

- `0` for `CALL`
- `1` for `CREATE`
- `2` for `CREATE2`
- `3` for `STATICCALL`

_Triggers the **[Executed](#executed)** event when a call is successfully executed using `CALL/STATICCALL` operations._

_Triggers the **[ContractCreated](#contractcreated)** event when a smart contract is created using `CREATE/CREATE2` operations._

:::note
The `execute(...)` function can only be called by the current owner of the vault.

The operation type `staticcall` (`3`) does not allow to transfer value.
:::

| `target`        | `address` | The address to interact with. `target` will be unused if a contract is created (operation 1 & 2).                        |
| `value`         | `uint256` | The amount of native tokens to transfer with the transaction (in Wei).                                                   |
