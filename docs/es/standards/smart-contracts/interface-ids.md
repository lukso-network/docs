# Interfaces IDs

**Interfaces IDs** help check if a contract supports a specific interface, e.g., its meta-interface. They are helpful if we want to interact with a contract but don't know if it supports an interface such as **[ERC725Y](https://github.com/ethereum/EIPs/blob/master/EIPS/eip-725.md#erc725y)**, **[LSP1UniversalReceiver](https://github.com/lukso-network/LIPs/blob/main/LSPs/LSP-1-UniversalReceiver.md)**, etc.

The **supportsInterface** function from the **[ERC165](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-165)** standard returns `true` if the standard is supported, `false` otherwise.

:::note
_Interface IDs are not the most secure way to ensure that a contract implements a specific set of functions, as they are manually set and can be set to any value._
:::

Interface IDs can be easily accessed in your code using the [LSP smart contract NPM package](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@lukso/lsp-smart-contracts) as follows. The accessible interface IDs can be found in the [constants.js file](https://github.com/lukso-network/lsp-smart-contracts/blob/main/constants.js)

```js
import { INTERFACE_IDS } from '@lukso/lsp-smart-contracts/constants.js';

const ERC725X_ID = INTERFACE_IDS.ERC725X;
```
