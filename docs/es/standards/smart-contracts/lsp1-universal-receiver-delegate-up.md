# LSP1UniversalReceiverDelegateUP

:::info Solidity contract

[`LSP1UniversalReceiverDelegateUP.sol`](https://github.com/lukso-network/lsp-smart-contracts/blob/main/contracts/LSP1UniversalReceiver/LSP1UniversalReceiverDelegateUP/LSP1UniversalReceiverDelegateUP.sol)

:::

The **LSP1UniversalReceiverDelegateUP** is a contract called by the **[`universalReceiver(...)`](./lsp0-erc725-account.md#universalreceiver)** function of the **[LSP0ERC725Account](./lsp0-erc725-account.md)** contract that:

- Writes the data keys representing assets received from type **[LSP7-DigitalAsset](./lsp7-digital-asset.md)** and **[LSP8-IdentifiableDigitalAsset](./lsp8-identifiable-digital-asset.md)** into the account storage, and removes them when the balance is zero according to the **[LSP5-ReceivedAssets Standard](https://github.com/lukso-network/LIPs/blob/main/LSPs/LSP-5-ReceivedAssets.md)**.

- Writes the data keys representing the owned vaults from type **[LSP9-Vault](./lsp9-vault.md)** into your account storage, and removes them when **transferring ownership** to other accounts according to the **[LSP10-ReceivedVaults Standard](https://github.com/lukso-network/LIPs/blob/main/LSPs/LSP-5-ReceivedAssets.md)**.

The following two requirements are required to execute the logic above correctly:

1. The owner of the **LSP0ERC725Account** contract should be an **[LSP6KeyManager](./lsp6-key-manager.md)** contract.
2. The **LSP1UniversalReceiverDelegateUP** contract should be granted **permission to [`SETDATA`](../universal-profile/lsp6-key-manager.md#permission-values)** on the account (otherwise, the transaction will pass but will not write any data keys to the storage).

:::note
_LSP1UniversalReceiverDelegateUP contract also contains the methods from the [ERC165 Standard](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-165):_

```solidity
function supportsInterface(bytes4 interfaceId) public view returns (bool)
```

## Functions

### universalReceiver

```solidity
function universalReceiver(
    bytes32 typeId,
    bytes memory data
) public payable returns (bytes memory result)
```

Writes the data keys of the received **LSP7DigitalAsset**, **LSP8IdentifiableDigitalAsset**, and **LSP9Vault** contract addresses into the account storage according to the **LSP5ReceivedAssets** and **LSP10-ReceivedVaults** Standard.

The data keys representing an asset/vault are cleared when the asset/vault is no longer owned by the account.

#### Parameters:

| Name     | Type      | Description                                                                  |
| :------- | :-------- | :--------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `typeId` | `bytes32` | The token hooks of the contract.                                             |
| `data`   | `bytes`   | The data that is associated with the asset or vault transfer (concatenated). |

> **Note:** if the function is called by LSP0's [`universalReceiver(...)`](./lsp0-erc725-account.md#universalreceiver) function, it will receives the following **extra calldata**:
>
> - `bytes20 caller`: The token's or vault's smart contract address.
> - `bytes32 value`: The amount of value sent to the universalReceiver function.

#### Return Values:

| Name     | Type    | Description                                                                                                       |
| :------- | :------ | :---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `result` | `bytes` | The value that is returned by the **Key Manager**'s **[`execute(...)`](./lsp6-key-manager.md#execute)** function. |
