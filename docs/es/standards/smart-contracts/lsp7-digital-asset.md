# LSP7DigitalAsset

:::info Solidity contract

[`LSP7DigitalAsset.sol`](https://github.com/lukso-network/lsp-smart-contracts/blob/main/contracts/LSP7DigitalAsset/LSP7DigitalAsset.sol)

:::

The **LSP7DigitalAsset** contract represents digital assets for either fungible or non-fungible tokens where minting and transferring are specified with an amount of tokens. It has some functions from **[ERC20](https://github.com/OpenZeppelin/openzeppelin-contracts/blob/master/contracts/token/ERC20/ERC20.sol)** and **[ERC777](https://github.com/OpenZeppelin/openzeppelin-contracts/blob/master/contracts/token/ERC777/ERC777.sol)** with more upgraded features.

This contract serves as a **Fungible Token Contract** when `isNonDivisible` bool is set to **false** in the `constructor(...)` and otherwise serves as a **Non-Fungible Token Contract**.

:::note
_The LSP7DigitalAsset contract also contains the methods from_ [_ERC165_](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-165) :

```solidity
function supportsInterface(bytes4 interfaceId) public view returns (bool)
```

:::

## Public Functions

### constructor

```solidity
constructor(
    string memory name_,
    string memory symbol_,
    address newOwner_,
    bool isNonDivisible_
) LSP4DigitalAssetMetadata(name_, symbol_, newOwner_)
```

Sets the **initial owner** of the token, and sets the following data keys on the [**ERC725Y Data Key-Value Store**](./lsp0-erc725-account#setdata):

- name: token's name.
- symbol: token's symbol.
- [**SupportedStandards:LSP4DigitalAsset**](https://github.com/lukso-network/LIPs/blob/main/LSPs/LSP-4-DigitalAsset-Metadata.md#supportedstandardslsp4digitalasset) data key.

The the `isNonDivisible` parameter specifies if the contract represents a fungible token or an NFT.

#### Parameters:

| Name              | Type      | Description                                                            |

| `newOwner_`       | `address` | The owner of the contract.                                             |
| `isNonDivisible_` | `bool`    | Specify if the contract represents a fungible or a non-fungible token. |

### decimals

```solidity
  function decimals() public view returns (uint256 value)
```

Returns the number of decimals used to get its user representation.

:::note
If the contract represents a **NFT** then **0** SHOULD be used, otherwise **18** is the common value.
:::

#### Return Values:

| Name    | Type      | Description                          |
| :------ | :-------- | :----------------------------------- |
| `value` | `uint256` | The number of decimals of the token. |

### totalSupply

```solidity
function totalSupply() public view returns (uint256 value)
```

Returns the number of existing tokens of this contract.

#### Return Values:

| Name    | Type      | Description                    |
| :------ | :-------- | :----------------------------- |
| `value` | `uint256` | The number of existing tokens. |

### balanceOf

```solidity
function balanceOf(address tokenOwner) public view returns (uint256 value)
```

Returns the number of existing tokens of the contract owned by the `tokenOwner` address.

#### Parameters:

### authorizeOperator

```solidity
function authorizeOperator(
    address operator,
    uint256 amount
) public
```

Sets the `amount` of tokens to which the `operator` has access from the caller's tokens.

To increase or decrease the authorized amount of an operator, it's advised to call [`revokeOperator(..)`](#revokeoperator) function first, and then re-call [`authorizeOperator(..)`](#authorizeoperator) with the new amount to authorize, to avoid front-running and Allowance Double-Spend Exploit.
Check more information in this [document](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1YLPtQxZu1UAvO9cZ1O2RPXBbT0mooh4DYKjA_jp-RLM/).

## Internal Functions

These internal functions can be extended via `override` to add some custom logic.

By deploying an LSP7DigitalAsset contract, there will be no public mint or burn function.
In order to use them you have to extend the smart contracts and create custom methods using the internal functions.

### \_updateOperator

```
function _updateOperator(
    address tokenOwner,
    address operator,
    uint256 amount
) internal virtual
```

Changes token `amount` the `operator` has access to from `tokenOwner` tokens. Setting the `amount` to zero is equivalent to revoking the operator.

_Triggers the **[AuthorizedOperator](#authorizedoperator)** event if an address gets authorized as an operator or **[RevokedOperator](#revokedoperator)** event if an address gets revoked as an operator._

#### Parameters

| Name         | Type      | Description                                  |
| :----------- | :-------- | :------------------------------------------- |
| `tokenOwner` | `address` | The address that is the owner of tokens.     |
| `operator`   | `address` | The address to authorize as an operator.     |
| `amount`     | `uint256` | The amount of tokens operator has access to. |

:::note

#### Requirements

- `operator` cannot be the zero address.
