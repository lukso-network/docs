## Using wallet extensions

If you simply want to play around with smart contracts, you can use a wallet extension like [Nifty](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/nifty-wallet/jbdaocneiiinmjbjlgalhcelgbejmnid) or [Meta-Mask](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/metamask/nkbihfbeogaeaoehlefnkodbefgpgknn), connect to https://rpc.l14.lukso.network and use [Remix](http://remix.ethereum.org/) to develop and deploy smart contracts.

## Faucet

The [L14 Faucet](http://faucet.l14.lukso.network) allows you to retrieve 5 LYX for your development. Simply enter your address, and they should appear within a few seconds on your account.

## Using Remix to deploy smart contracts

To connect [Remix](http://remix.ethereum.org/) to the L14 testnet, connect your wallet extension to your own, or [our custom RPC endpoint](https://rpc.l14.lukso.network). In Remix simply choose from the tab *"Run" > "Environment"* and select *"Injected Web3"*.

This will allow you to program and deploy smart contracts, using the Remix interface on the L14 testnet.

## Tutorials

There are a number of tutorials which teach you the basics of [Solidity](http://solidity.readthedocs.io/en/latest/), the most used EVM smart contract language.
Here are two that you can start with:

- [EthereumBuilder's Solidity Tutorials](https://ethereumbuilders.gitbooks.io/guide/content/en/solidity_tutorials.html)
- [Codeburst Solidity Tutorial](https://codeburst.io/build-your-first-ethereum-smart-contract-with-solidity-tutorial-94171d6b1c4b) - Start here at the heading "Remix Web Browser IDE"

You can find the documentation for Solidity [here](http://solidity.readthedocs.io/en/latest/).

## Developer tools

To develop DApps, you can use [web3.js](https://github.com/ethereum/web3.js/), the most comprehensive tool for developing DApps in JavaScript. You can find the documentation [here](https://web3js.readthedocs.io/en/1.0/).

## Network information

You can see all transaction on our [BlockScout explorer](http://explorer.l14.lukso.network/).

There are apps for [validators](http://validators.l14.lukso.network/) and [validator voting](http://voting.l14.lukso.network/), which you can have a look if your wallet extension is connected to the L14 testnet.
