| [Key Manager](/standards/access-control/lsp6-key-manager.md)                                       | The Key Manager is essentially a place where you can manage permissions that other _things_ have on your Universal Profile. _Things_ could be other people's profiles, dapps, extensions....anything.                                                                                                                                                                                                                             |
| [ERC725X](/standards/metadata/lsp2-json-schema.md)                                                 | ERC725X is a standard that defines how your Universal Profile works and how it can be used to manage your online identity and assets. It's like a set of rules that everyone agrees on, making it easier for different applications and platforms to understand and interact with your profile.                                                                                                                                   |

| [LYXt](../../docs/faq/lukso/general-information.md#whats-the-difference-between-lyxt-lyxe-and-lyx) | LYXt is the token for developers to use on our testnet. It can always be acquired by anyone for free.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             |
| [LYXe](../../docs/faq/lukso/general-information.md#whats-the-difference-between-lyxt-lyxe-and-lyx) | LYXe is the token that was deployed on Ethereum before LUKSO Mainnet was launched. It allowed people to invest in LUKSO pre-launch.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               |
| [Metadata](/standards/metadata/lsp3-profile-metadata.md)                                           | This typically refers to the additional data that is stored against a token or NFT. The difference on LUKSO is it can be extended. <br></br> For example, imagine you've bought a house and have the deed as an NFT on LUKSO. Well now, as renovations are carried out, they can be continually added to the NFT for history.                                                                                                    |
| Account Abstraction                                                                                | Account abstraction is abstracting away smart contract execution from storing funds. With a smart contract account, you can program it to do all sorts of things. You can set up automatic payments, create multi-signature wallets that require multiple people to approve transactions, or even add security features like daily spending limits. It's like having a customizable, programmable bank account on the blockchain. |
