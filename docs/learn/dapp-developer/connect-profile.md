# Connect a Universal Profile

To interact with a [Universal Profile](../../standards/universal-profile/introduction.md), we recommend your dApp to call the `window.lukso` object within the browser. Before a connection can be established, users have to create their Universal Profile by:

1. [Installing the Universal Profile Browser Extension](/install-up-browser-extension)
2. [Deploying their Universal Profile](https://my.universalprofile.cloud)

:::info Wallet Compatibility

Alternatively to calling the `window.lukso` object, the equivalent `window.ethereum` object can be called within [supported browsers](/install-up-browser-extension), just like other Ethereum wallets.

:::

:::note Manual Deployment

You can also create new [Universal Profiles](../../standards/universal-profile/introduction.md) by ‚öíÔ∏è [deploying them programmatically](../../learn/expert-guides/universal-profile/create-profile.md). However, please keep in mind that you would also have to deploy your own [Transaction Relay Service](../../standards/relayer-api.md) to allow gasless onboarding. Customly deployed profiles will not receive free monthly transaction quota through the LUKSO Transaction Relay Service.

## Connect to a dApp

:::success Request Handling

The [Universal Profile Extension](/install-up-browser-extension) automatically manages incoming requests and returns the address of the connected [Universal Profile](../../standards/universal-profile/introduction.md). To get the conrolling EOAs of the [smart contract account](../../standards/universal-profile/lsp0-erc725account.md), you can manually [fetch it's controllers](../expert-guides/key-manager/get-controller-permissions.md).

:::

```js
import Web3 from 'web3';
const web3 = new Web3(window.lukso);

async function connect() {
  await web3.eth.requestAccounts();

  try {
    const accounts = await web3.eth.requestAccounts();
    console.log('Connected with', accounts[0]);
  } catch (error) {
    // handle connection error
  }
}
connect();
```

:::info Handling Multiple Extensions

If you expect your users to have multiple browser wallets or extensions, we recommend installing [Web3 Onboard](https://onboard.blocknative.com/) by following our [Web3 Onboard Configuration](./web3-onboard.md). The library will allow users to manage multiple browser providers in parallel.

Alternatively, you can use a simple fallback, in case the [Universal Profile Browser Extension](/install-up-browser-extension) is not installed:

```js
const providerObject = window.lukso || window.ethereum;
const web3 = new Web3(providerObject);
```
