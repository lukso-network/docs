# Log-in a Universal Profile (SIWE)

The [Universal Profile Browser Extension](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/universal-profiles/abpickdkkbnbcoepogfhkhennhfhehfn) is compatible with [EIP-4361: Sign-In with Ethereum](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-4361).
Therefore, if the message you want to sign complies with this standard, the LUKSO UP Browser Extension will show a custom login screen.

## Setup

The following code snippets require to install a few libraries.

```shell
npm install web3 @lukso/lsp-smart-contracts siwe
```

## Get the Universal Profile address

```js
import Web3 from 'web3';

const web3 = new Web3(window.lukso);

// Request the user's Universal Profile address
await web3.eth.requestAccounts();
const accounts = await web3.eth.getAccounts();
```

## Sign the message

Once you have access to the Universal Profile address, you can request a signature. The UP Browser Extension will sign the message with the controller key used by the extension (a smart contract can't sign by itself).

:::tip SIWE Specification

If you need further explanation on the `SiweMessage` properties, please have a look at the [EIP-4361](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-4361) specification.

```js
import UniversalProfileContract from '@lukso/lsp-smart-contracts/artifacts/UniversalProfile.json';
import { SiweMessage } from 'siwe';

const myUniversalProfileContract = new web3.eth.Contract(
  UniversalProfileContract.abi,
  accounts[0],
);

// To enable the Sign-In With Ethereum (SIWE) screen, you need to prepare a message with a specific format
const hashedMessage = web3.eth.accounts.hashMessage(
  new SiweMessage({
    domain: window.location.host, // Domain requesting the signing
    address: upAddress,           // Address performing the signing
    statement: 'By logging in you agree to the terms and conditions.', // a human-readable assertion user signs
    uri: window.location.origin,  // URI from the resource that is the subject of the signing
    version: '1',                 // Current version of the SIWE Message
    chainId: '4201',              // Chain ID to which the session is bound, 4201 is LUKSO Testnet
    resources: ['https://terms.website.com'], // Information the user wishes to have resolved as part of authentication by the relying party
  }).prepareMessage(),
);

// Request the user to sign the login message with his Universal Profile
// The UP Browser Extension will sign the message with the controller key used by the extension (a smart contract can't sign)
const signature = await web3.eth.sign(siweMessage, accounts[0]);
// 0x38c53...
```

    <summary>Raw SIWE message format</summary>

```js
const domain = window.location.host; // Domain requesting the signing
const uri = window.location.origin; // URI from the resource that is the subject of the signing
const LUKSO_TESTNET_CHAIN_ID = '4201';
const nonce = 'm97bdsjo'; // A randomized token, at least 8 alphanumeric characters
const issuedAt = new Date().toISOString(); // The time when the message was generated

const siweMessage = `${domain} wants you to sign in with your Ethereum account:

${usersUPaddress}

By logging in you agree to the terms and conditions.

URI: ${uri}
Version: 1
Chain ID: ${LUKSO_TESTNET_CHAIN_ID}
Nonce: ${nonce}
Issued At: ${issuedAt}
Resources:
- https://terms.website.com`;
```

</details>

## Verify the signature on the user's Universal Profile

Your dApp has now received a message signed by the controller address of the Universal Profile. To finalise the login, you need to verify if the message was signed by an address which has the [`SIGN`](../../standards/universal-profile/lsp6-key-manager.md#permissions) permission for this UP.

To do so, you can use the [`isValidSignature(...)`](../../contracts/contracts/UniversalProfile.md#isvalidsignature) function ([EIP-1271](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-1271)) to check the signature.

```js
// If the signature is valid it should return the success value 0x1626ba7e.
// Then, the message was signed by an EOA which has a SIGN (https://github.com/lukso-network/standards/universal-profile/lsp6-key-manager#permissions)permission for this Universal Profile.
// For additional details, check https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-1271
const isValidSignature = await myUniversalProfileContract.methods
  .isValidSignature(hashedMessage, signature)
  .call();

if (isValidSignature === '0x1626ba7e') {
  console.log('Log In successful!');
} else {
  // The EOA which signed the message has no SIGN permission over this UP.
  console.log('Log In failed');
}
```
