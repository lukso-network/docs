Welcome to the AI Tools page. This is a short mock page to demonstrate where AI-related tooling docs will live.

## How to use

Copy a prompt to a file in your repo (for example `ai/prompts/<topic>.md`). Then include the file when chatting with your AI assistant.

- With Cursor, add it as project rules or reference the file with `@Files`.
- With GitHub Copilot, use `#<filename>`.
- With Zed, use `/file`.

These prompts are starting points. Adjust versions, file paths, and naming to fit your project.
