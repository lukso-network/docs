# Create a LSP1 Forwarder

In this guide, we will create a custom [Universal Receiver Delegate](../../standards/generic-standards/lsp1-universal-receiver-delegate.md) contract. This contract will be called each time the associated UP receives a [LSP7 token](../../standards/tokens/LSP7-Digital-Asset.md), and will forward a certain percentage to another address.

The use-case it answers is:

> **"As a Universal Profile (UP) owner, I want to transfer part of the tokens I received to another UP"**.

An example scenario could be: _"each time I receive USDT, I want to automatically transfer 20% to my wife's UP"_.

## Setup & Requirements

:::success Tips

If you want to follow this guide using not an existing token, but a new token that you want to create and deploy yourself, check our guide [**"Create a Custom LSP7 Token"**](../digital-assets/smart-contract-developers/getting-started.md#create-a-custom-lsp7-token-contract).

:::

:::info

This guide is working with version above 0.14.0 of the [`@lukso/lsp-smart-contracts`] package.

:::

In order to follow this guide, you will need the followings:

1. Downloaded and installed the [UP Browser extension](/install-up-browser-extension).
2. Fund the main EOA controller of your üÜô (See **[Step 1](#step-1---enable-your-controller-to-add-a-universal-receiver) bullet point 3** to retrieve its address) using the [Testnet Faucet](https://faucet.testnet.lukso.network/).
3. The address of the LSP7 token that you want to use to forward of portion of the amount received.
4. Installed the v0.14.0 [`@lukso/lsp-smart-contracts`](../../contracts/introduction.md) library.

```bash
npm i @lukso/lsp-smart-contracts@v0.14.0
```

## Step 1 - Enable your controller to Add & Edit a Universal Receiver

First, we will need to enable adding a Universal Receiver for the main controller of our UP. To do that:

1. Open the UP Browser Extension in your web browser.
2. Click on the **"Controller"** tab.
3. Select **"UP Extension"** which.

This will bring the controller information page that you see below. From there:

4. Scroll down to the **"Administration & Ownership"** part
5. Toggle ON the **"Add notifications & automation"** + **"Edit notifications & automation"** permission.
6. Confirm the changes and submit the transaction.

## Step 2 - Create LSP1 Forwarder contract in Solidity

The custom LSP1 Delegate contract can be created using 2 methods of interaction flows.

### Two Design Options

In order to transfer a portion of the tokens received to another address, we can instruct the LSP1 Forwarder contract to re-call the LSP7 [`transfer(...)`](../../contracts/contracts/LSP7DigitalAsset/LSP7DigitalAsset.md#transfer) function:

- **method 1:** via the [**`execute(...)` function of the üÜô**](../../contracts/contracts/UniversalProfile/UniversalProfile.md#execute).
- **method 2:** directly on the LSP7 contract **after having authorized the LSP1 Forwarder as an operator via [`authorizeOperator(...)`](../../contracts/contracts/LSP7DigitalAsset/LSP7DigitalAsset.md#authorizeoperator)**.

For method 1 to work, the LSP1 Forwarder contract will need the permissions [`SUPER_CALL` + `REENTRANCY`](../../standards/universal-profile/lsp6-key-manager.md#permissions) on the UP.

For method 2 to work, the LSP1 Forwarder contract needs to be authorized as an operator at the LSP7 level (using [`authorizeOperator`](../../../contracts/contracts/LSP7DigitalAsset/#authorizeoperator)) with unlimited amount (`type(uint256).max`).

Below are some of the advantages and disadvantages of both methods.

| Design Method                                                        | Advantages üëçüèª                                                                                                                           | Disadvantages üëéüèª                                                                   |
| :------------------------------------------------------------------- | :-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | :--------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Method 1:** via üÜô `execute(...)` function                         | Does not requires additional setup (`authorizeOperator` operation) <br/> Can trace the transfer from your UP transactions' activity tab | Cost a bit more gas (+/- 23k) compared to method 2 on the re-transfer transaction. |
| **Method 2:** via `authorizeOperator(...)` on LSP7 Token contract ü™ô | More gas efficient.                                                                                                                     | You have to authorize your URD to spend your LSP7 token for an unlimited amount    |

The code is commented enough to be self explanatory, but let's dive a bit more into some interesting bits.

    }
}
```

**Creation of the transaction**

When all the verifications passed in the `universalReceiver` function, we calculate the amount of token to transfer (`tokensToTransfer`) and create the transaction that will be executed:

```solidity title="Create the transaction"
bytes memory encodedTx = abi.encodeCall(
    ILSP7DigitalAsset.transfer,
    msg.sender,
    recipient,
    tokensToTransfer,
    true,
    ""
);
```

The `encodeCall` function takes the function that will be called as 1st parameter, and its parameters as the following ones. Here, we target the `transfer` method of the LSP7 token that we received (e.g., the notifier), and we need 4 additional parameters:

- the `from` (msg.sender => the UP that received tokens)
- the `to` (recipient => the address that will receives part of the tokens)
- the `amount` (tokensToTransfer => a percentage of the total amount received)
- the `allowNonLSP1Recipient` boolean that indicates if we can transfer to any address, or if it has to be a LSP1 enabled one
- the `data` (no additional data)

**Execution of the transaction**

Directly after creating our encoded transaction, we can execute it using the following line:

```solidity title="Execute the transaction"
IERC725X(msg.sender).execute(0, notifier, 0, encodedTx);
```

As we know from the `// CHECK that the caller is a LSP0 (UniversalProfile)` test, the `msg.sender` is a Universal Profile which extends `ERC725XCore`. We can then explicitly convert `msg.sender` as a ERC725X contract, then call the `execute` function on it. This means that we "run the execute function as the Universal Profile". The parameters are:

- the `operationType` (0 = CALL operation)
- the `target` (notifier = our LSP7 contract)
- the `value` (in native token) (0 = nothing is sent)
- the `data` (our encoded transaction)

```

In this method, we're directly calling the `transfer` method of the notifier (the LSP7 token) as the URD. Of course, in order for this to work, the custom URD needs to be authorized to spend the token of the UP on his behalf (using `authorizeOperator`).

## Step 3 - Register our LSP1 Forwarder

You now have a custom LSP1 Delegate forwarder contract that we will register on our Universal Profile in the [second part of this guide](./deploy-receiver-forwarder.md)!
