# L16 Public Testnet
 

:::info Network values DO NOT represent the final mainnet values
Values and configuration parameters for this network, as well as suggested hardware specs, DO NOT represent the final values for the LUKSO mainnet. Those will be announced shortly before mainnet launch.
:::

The L16 Public Testnet will be the last stable test network before the mainnet launch and will likely stay online in parallel for experimental purposes.

:::info
Apple's new M1 chips are not supported natively by our node client. However, you can follow [this guide](https://medium.com/@luki3k5/running-lukso-node-on-m1-mac-acf92d433a38) to run it by using Rosetta, Apple's built-in emulation software.

### Configure your firewall
**LINUX**

Using the lukso-cli will open the ports for you automatically.  If you have a firewall configured, please allow traffic for the above mentioned ports, you can use the following commands to configure your firewall correctly:

```
sudo ufw default deny incoming
sudo ufw default allow outgoing 
```
```
sudo ufw allow 30303/tcp
sudo ufw allow 30303/udp
sudo ufw allow 13000/tcp
sudo ufw allow 12000/udp
```
```
sudo ufw enable
```
The firewall will be active after restarting your system.

**MAC**

```
This section is in the works
```

:::info
NOTE: Make sure you also forward those ports in your router.

### Installing Dependencies

Prepare your **Linux** environment. You need:

1. [Docker](https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/)
2. [Docker Compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/)
3. [curl](https://macappstore.org/curl/) 

```bash title="Example script for installing docker"
# Install dependencies
sudo apt-get -y update
sudo apt-get -y install curl

# Install Docker
curl -fsSL https://get.docker.com -o get-docker.sh
sudo sh get-docker.sh

# Install Docker Compose
sudo curl -L "https://github.com/docker/compose/releases/download/1.29.2/docker-compose-$(uname -s)-$(uname -m)" -o /usr/local/bin/docker-compose
sudo chmod +x /usr/local/bin/docker-compose
sudo ln -s /usr/local/bin/docker-compose /usr/bin/docker-compose
docker-compose --version
```

To prepare your **Mac** environment. You need:
1. [Homebrew package manager](https://brew.sh)
2. [Docker Desktop for Mac](https://docs.docker.com/desktop/mac/install/)
3. [curl](https://macappstore.org/curl/)

```bash title="Example script for installing docker"
# Install Homebrew 
/bin/bash -c "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/install/HEAD/install.sh)"

# Install Curl
sudo brew install curl

# Install Docker Desktop for Mac
Go to https://docs.docker.com/desktop/mac/install/ and install the application. 
You do not have to install Docker Compose separately
```

## Setting up Metamask

| Setting                      | Value                                                |
| ---------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------- |
| Network Name                 | L16                                             |

**[here is a tutorial on how to add a network to Metamask.](https://metamask.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/360043227612-How-to-add-a-custom-network-RPC)**

### Installing the Node

```bash
mkdir lukso-l16-testnet && cd lukso-l16-testnet
sudo curl https://raw.githubusercontent.com/lukso-network/lukso-cli/main/install.sh | sudo bash
```

The script will download the LUKSO cli into the folder. 
 
#### Setting up your node and node name
```bash
lukso network init --chain l16
```
 

## Starting the Node

```bash
# Start your nodes
lukso network start
```

## Become a Validator

### Setup Validator

```
lukso network validator setup
```

This will create a key store and a transaction wallet. The purpose of the transaction wallet is to call and pay for the deposit
transaction. You can check if the wallet has enough funds by calling

```
lukso network validator describe
```

Visit the [Faucet](https://faucet.l16.lukso.network) and paste the transaction wallet public key into the input field.

Transfer **enough** (#validators x staking_amount **+ extra LYXt to pay deposit fees**) funds to the transaction wallet public's address.

 

#### Submit the transaction.

Make a dry run first

```bash
lukso network validator deposit --dry
```

This will give you the possibility to peek in what is going to happen without executing a transaction.

If you are sure that everything is correct you run the command


```bash
lukso network validator deposit
```

It can take up to eight hours before your validator becomes active, but you can already start your validator in the meantime.

Once you deposited LYXt make sure to create a backup.

```bash
lukso network validator backup
```

Store the file **node_recovery.json** somewhere safe.

### Start the Validator Client

```bash
# Make sure your _consensus_ and _execution_ clients are running
lukso network validator start

# You can check logs with
lukso network log validator -f

You can close your logs by pressing ctrl+c

# You can stop the validator using, this will also stop all other nodes
lukso network validator stop
```

Occasionally check the status of your validator by either typing

```bash
lukso network validator describe
```

Or by visiting the [Explorer](https://explorer.consensus.l16.lukso.network)

## Check your logs
```
lukso network log consensus -f
lukso network log execution -f
```

You can close your logs by pressing ctrl+c

## Stop your node
```
lukso network stop
```


##### If you selected a wrong chain, you could reset the setup. This will delete all related data except the keystores.
##### NOTE: the network must be stopped
```
lukso network clear
```

### Check the Network Status

You can see your node on the following pages:

1. [https://stats.execution.l16.lukso.network](https://stats.execution.l16.lukso.network)
2. [https://stats.consensus.l16.lukso.network](https://stats.consensus.l16.lukso.network)



## Troubleshooting L16 Testnet

### Permission denied

If you get an error that the permission is denied use `sudo` in front of your command.

### Bootnodes

You can update Bootnodes with


```bash
lukso network update
```

You need to restart the chain to make the changes effective

```
lukso network restart
```
 
### Unmarshalling Error

:::info Context
Check your execution log by `lukso network log execution`. For Ubuntu 20.04 LTS you may get an unmarshal-related issue like:

```
log_execution: err="peer connected on snap without compatible eth support" log_consensus: level=error msg="Could not connect to powchain endpoint: could not dial eth1 nodes: json: cannot unmarshal string into Go struct field SyncProgress.CurrentBlock of type uint64" prefix=powchain
```

:::

**Proposed Solution:**

```sh
# stop docker container
lukso network stop
# reset data directory
lukso network clear
# remove previous images
docker system prune --all --force --volumes
# delete lukso testnet directory
cd .. && rm -rf ./lukso-l16-testnet
```

After trying out the proposed solution, re-run your node setup from the start.
