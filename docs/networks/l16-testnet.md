# L16 Public Testnet
 

The L16 Public Testnet will be the last stable test network before the mainnet launch and will likely stay online in parallel for experimental purposes.

:::info
Apple's new M1 chips are not supported natively by our node client. However, you can follow [this guide](https://medium.com/@luki3k5/running-lukso-node-on-m1-mac-acf92d433a38) to run it by using Rosetta, Apple's built-in emulation software.
:::

## Running a Node

### Installing Dependencies

Prepare your environment. You need:

1. [Docker](https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/)
2. [Docker Compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/)
3. [curl](https://macappstore.org/curl/) 
4. nano
5. bash

```bash title="Example script for installing docker"
# install dependencies
sudo apt-get -y update
sudo apt-get -y install curl bash nano

# install docker
curl -fsSL https://get.docker.com -o get-docker.sh
sudo sh get-docker.sh

# install docker-compose
sudo curl -L "https://github.com/docker/compose/releases/download/1.29.2/docker-compose-$(uname -s)-$(uname -m)" -o /usr/local/bin/docker-compose
sudo chmod +x /usr/local/bin/docker-compose
sudo ln -s /usr/local/bin/docker-compose /usr/bin/docker-compose
docker-compose --version
```

### Installing the Node

```bash
mkdir lukso-l16-testnet && cd lukso-l16-testnet
curl https://raw.githubusercontent.com/lukso-network/lukso-cli/main/cli_downloader.sh | bash
```

The script will download the LUKSO cli into the folder. You can put into your PATH var with:

Linux:
```
sudo mv ~/lukso /usr/local/bin
```

Mac:
```
sudo mv /usr/local/bin usr/local/bin.old
```
 Or execute it directly with

```bash
sudo lukso network init
```

### Naming the Node

**Optional:** If you want change your node's name, you need to edit the `name` variable in the `node_config.yaml` file to update your node name. You can find it under the top level key `node` and you can edit it with nano:

```bash
nano .env
```

If your node is already running, you will need to restart it to apply the changes.

### Starting the Node

```bash
# Start your nodes
sudo lukso network init

# You can check logs with
sudo lukso network log consensus -f
sudo lukso network log execution -f

close your logs with control+c

# Stop your nodes
sudo lukso network stop

# If your nodes are stopped, you could reset them using
# Reset clears the database, which forces your node to sync again on start
sudo lukso network clear
```

### Check the Network Status

You can see your node on the following page:


1. [https://execution.stats.beta.l16.lukso.network](https://execution.stats.beta.l16.lukso.network)
2. [https://consensus.stats.beta.l16.lukso.network](https://consensus.stats.beta.l16.lukso.network)

## Become a Validator

### Request LYXt Tokens:

1. Make sure to install [MetaMask](https://metamask.io/).

2. Add the L16 Beta Testnet to [MetaMask](https://metamask.io/), by following [this tutorial](https://blog.suhailkakar.com/add-custom-networks-to-metamask).
3. Use the MetaMask parameters from above and select `L16 Beta` from the dropdown.
4. Copy your MetaMask address to the clipboard using the box icon.
5. Visit the [L16 Faucet](https://faucet.beta.l16.lukso.network), paste the copied address and request your test tokens.
6. Wait for the transaction to go through and check the balance in your MetaMask. You should have received 35 LYX.

### Create a Wallet

THIS SECTION IS BEING RE DONE 

### Submit the Deposit Transaction

#### Get your Address and Private Key from MetaMask

1. Open MetaMask and click on the three dots menu on the right side and select `Account details.`
2. Click on Export Private Key and copy it into the clipboard.

#### Update Secrets and submit Transaction

THIS SECTION IS BEING RE DONE 

#### Send the transaction.

```bash
# submit deposit
sudo lukso network validator deposit

# wait 8h till validator is activated
```

You will need to wait for eight hours to activate your validator.

### Run the Validator Client

Once your validator is activated, you spin up a validator client.

**Make sure your _consensus_ and _execution_ clients are running (by typing `sudo lukso network start`).**

```bash
sudo lukso network start validator

# You can check logs with
sudo lukso network log validator -f

close your logs with control+c

# You can stop the validator using, this will also stop all other nodes
sudo lukso network stop
```

## Troubleshooting L16 Beta Testnet
 

### Stalled Synchronization

:::info Context
You found your consensus (prysm) client has no peer and the execution engine (geth) stops syncing after a few blocks.
:::

**Proposed Solution:**

1. Open `node_config.yaml` file using any text editor. For `nano` the command will be `nano node_config.yaml`
2. Change `bootnode` in the `consensus` section to

```
enr:-MK4QOoOAELWWC0dZ7hwZzDY3NhxbGJWB9JFBGsIswzF383NRPNh7vfI_K4gt5KMCFt6-NrMbUdizURmcKE5xjfRhBaGAYBwAjI7h2F0dG5ldHOIAAAAAAAAAACEZXRoMpAMEg0LYQAAcAMAAAAAAAAAgmlkgnY0gmlwhCPMBSuJc2VjcDI1NmsxoQO4XSsbls7lyhfqvcsgS8jmjFmBpC3dekXssvAEXkHtJYhzeW5jbmV0cwCDdGNwgjLIg3VkcIIu4A
```

3. Restart the node by typing: `sudo lukso network stop && lukso network start`

### Unmarshalling Error

:::info Context
Check your execution log by `sudo lukso network log execution -f`. For Ubuntu 20.04 LTS you may get an unmarshal-related issue like:

```
log_execution: err="peer connected on snap without compatible eth support" log_consensus: level=error msg="Could not connect to powchain endpoint: could not dial eth1 nodes: json: cannot unmarshal string into Go struct field SyncProgress.CurrentBlock of type uint64" prefix=powchain
```

:::

**Proposed Solution:**

```sh
# stop docker containser
sudo lukso network stop
# reset data directory
sudo lukso network clear
# remove previous images
docker system prune --all --force --volumes
# delete lukso testnet directory
cd .. && rm -rf lukso-l16-testnet
```

After trying out the proposed solution, re-run your node setup from the start.

## FAQ

### What ports must be open on a node?

It would be best if you opened the following ports and protocols in the network to run your node correctly.

```
tcp:30303
tcp:8545
tcp:8598
tcp:8080
tcp:3500
tcp:4000
tcp:13000
udp:12000
udp:30303
```
