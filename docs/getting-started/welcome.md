# Getting Started on LUKSO

## Welcome to LUKSO!

The purpose of this section is to get you to coding as fast as a possible. We will therefore try to take you step by step through the basics and as fast as possible to coding.

For more detailed information on any topic please search or head over to our [Learn](../learn/introduction.md) section.

## First Steps for Everyone

The first steps are to get familiar with our most basic tools for interacting with the LUKSO blockchain.

First is our browser extension, follow the link below to install it:

<div style={{ display: 'flex', justifyContent: 'center', marginTop: '2em' }}>
  <CallToActionButton
    color="white"
    target="_blank"
    link="https://chromewebstore.google.com/detail/universal-profiles/abpickdkkbnbcoepogfhkhennhfhehfn"
    text="Install the Universal Profile Browser Extension ðŸ§©"
  />
</div>

Next create your first Universal Profile and set up Recovery (optional):

<div
  style={{
    display: 'flex',
    justifyContent: 'center',
  }}
>
  <CallToActionButton
    color="white"
    target="_blank"
    link="https://my.universalprofile.cloud"
    text="Create your Universal Profile ðŸ†™"
  />
</div>

Great, now you have the two most fundamental elements of LUKSO! Now is probably a good time to explore the [ecosystem](https://www.lukso.network/ecosystem).

## Next Steps for.....

### dApp Developers

If you are anything like us, you'll want to start coding now. While there is lots of details to dive into, the best starting place is our boilerplate dapp. This gives you a fully working dapp to play around with all of the basic functionality.

[Check it out!](../learn/universal-profile/getting-started#nextjs-boilerplate)

### Smart Contract Developers

If you are a Smart Contract Developer, the boilerplate is a good starting point too.

But you also you might want to check out our [Smart Contracts guide](../learn/digital-assets/smart-contract-developers/getting-started).

You'll find all the information to quickly get coding.

### Validators

Last but not least, for our validator friends.

We recommend starting off on Testnet and you can find all the information you need on [Running a Testnet Node here](../networks/testnet/running-a-node) or you can go straight to [Mainnet here](../networks/mainnet/running-a-node.md).
