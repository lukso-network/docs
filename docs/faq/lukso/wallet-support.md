# Wallet Support

## Whats the best way to use LUKSO?

It's suggested to use the [Universal Profile Extension](/install-up-browser-extension) while interacting with apps and services on LUKSO. The extension offers you a much more user-friendly and feature-rich experience than you would get using regular wallets.

## Can the Universal Profile Extension be considered a wallet?

The Universal Profile Extension should not be classified as a wallet. While connected Universal Profiles can store assets, the extension serves as a comprehensive center for your blockchain interactions and reflects your on-chain persona with much more capabilities than just holding assets. Each Universal Profile within an extension holds a separate private key that can be exported into any regular Ethereum wallet.

## Which wallets can be used with the LUKSO network?

LUKSO is an EVM-compatible network. Therefore, any Ethereum wallet that allows custom networks can be used on the LUKSO network. You can find all the parameters of the LUKSO mainnet within the [Network](../../networks/mainnet/parameters.md) section.

## Can I use hardware wallets to store LYX?

Yes, you can use hardware wallets for LUKSO. [Ledger](https://www.ledger.com/) provides official support on Ledger devices and Ledger Live software. You can find more information in their [LYX Onboarding Guide](https://support.ledger.com/hc/en-us/articles/15847276545053). If you use the same Ethereum address for LUKSO and other networks, those will show up as separate accounts but share the same private key and address.

You can also send and receive assets using any other Ethereum hardware wallet, such as or [Trezor](https://trezor.io/), that can be connected to a browser-based wallet like [MetaMask](https://metamask.io/), [Rabby](https://rabby.io/), or [Rainbow](https://rainbow.me/). To see your LYX, you must add the LUKSO Mainnet as a custom network. The parameters can be found on the [Network](../../networks/mainnet/parameters.md) page.

> MetaMask might show a _network duplication warning_. This is because the chain ID of the LUKSO mainnet (`42`) equals the Kovan testnet of Ethereum. The reference might be updated soon. It is nothing to worry about.
