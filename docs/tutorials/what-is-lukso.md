## Who is LUKSO intended for?

LUKSO is intended for creative economies, where identities play a key role.
LUKSO allows brands, creatives and developers to dictate the distribution of wealth and influence from lifestyle activities. They can do so by having Universal Profiles (UPs), creating Digital Identities and Certificates, and building Tokenized Communities.

Topics related to **identity**, **assets representation**, **relay execution** and **smart contract interaction** require standardization. Such standards should be flexible enough to support and allow more potential use cases in the future.

## Why choose LUKSO?

[LSPs](/standards/introduction.md) (LUKSO Standard Proposals) are the building blocks of LUKSO. They are used to to build blockchain-based applications that offer an enhanced user experience, and allow for more flexibility and interaction.
