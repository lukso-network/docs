<h3>The current **Blockchain User Experience** comes with many limitations...</h3>
<h3>...not necessarily because of the complexity but due to the broken infrastructure.</h3>

<h3>Represented by the old underlying <strong>Standards</strong> and <strong>Tools</strong> used to operate on the network.</h3>

<h3>Change should start from the bottom to create a better user experience on the blockchain, from fundamental pieces to the top.</h3>

## Who is LUKSO intended for?

LUKSO is intended for creative economies, where identities play a key role.
LUKSO allows brands, creatives and developers to dictate the distribution of wealth and influence from lifestyle activities. They can do so by having Universal Profiles (UPs), creating Digital Identities and Certificates, and building Tokenized Communities.

Topics related to **identity**, **assets representation**, **relay execution** and **smart contract interaction** require standardization. Such standards should be flexible enough to support and allow more potential use cases in the future.

## Why choose LUKSO?

[LSPs](/standards/introduction.md) (LUKSO Standard Proposals) are the building blocks of LUKSO. They are used to to build blockchain-based applications that offer an enhanced user experience, and allow for more flexibility and interaction.
