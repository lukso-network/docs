# Install the Universal Profile (UP) Browser Extension

:::danger

The UP Browser Extension is a **BETA Phase**. DO NOT use this in production!
The current UP Browser Extension deploys profiles on the [Testnet](http://docs.lukso.tech/networks/testnet/parameters). Please DO NOT SEND any real funds to your TESTNET Universal Profile, as doing so will result in loss of funds.

:::

:::note
If you have **MetaMask** installed, _right click on both_ MetaMask and UP Extension and select _"This Can Read and Change Site Data > When you Click the Extension"_. Then you can select for every website which extension you use. By closing the tab you can reset this selection.

**It is important not to forget the previous step. Otherwise, it might conflict with the UP Browser Extension, and this might prevent you from finalising the setup process.**
