**_NOTE:_** You can use the same Twitter and Discord profiles for multiple Universal Profiles (UPs). The verification steps for using Twitter/ Discord are not linked to particular profiles.
The verification is in place for using the relayer. The relayer plays a vital role in subsidizing gas costs for early users and the verification process is in place to prevent bots from abusing the gas quota.

#### 2. Select your backup email.
