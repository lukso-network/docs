# Key Manager

The Key Manager uses the concept of [permissions](/docs/standards/access-control/lsp6-key-manager.md#permissions) to _authorize_ any addresses (dApps, protocols, devices, etc‚Ä¶) to do certain specific actions on the contract it is linked to. But why should you give anybody access to your smart contract? What is the intention behind doing this?

A Key Manager can be used with different setups by being linked to:

- **a LSP0ERC725Account like a Universal Profile**: to access your UP from other devices (that hold private keys), give access to some of your UP's functionalities to some dApps, or to create a DAO.
- **a Token contract**: to manage a token or NFT collection that was created in collaboration with multiple brands.

## Example of permissions usage

### For a Universal Profile

When looking at your Universal Profile within the üÜô Browser Extension, your EOA / private keys held within your device (Browser or Mobile) is _the address that holds all the permissions_. We refer to this as the **main controller**.

You can then grant partial access to any address so that they can use your Universal Profile to interact on your behalf in a controlled manner. For example:

| Example                     | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           | Permissions                                                                                                                                      |
| :-------------------------- | :------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ | :----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Treasury & Funds Manager    | Allow certain addresses to transfer your native tokens (or any LSP7 tokens) to certain specific addresses (_e.g: allow a crypto accountant or treasury manager to manage your funds on your behalf, allow a video game dApp to transfer the game tokens, etc..._)                     | `SUPER_TRANSFERVALUE` <br/> or `TRANSFERVALUE` + Allowed Calls on specific addresses <br/> or `CALL` + Allowed Calls on certain token addresses. |
| Brand Manager               | Allow certain addresses representing Marketing managers to either manage the metadata (and branding) of your Universal Profile, or the metadata of any NFT collections created by your Universal Profile.                                                                             | `SETDATA` + Allowed ERC725Y Data Keys to manage the UP <br/> `CALL` + Allowed Calls on specific NFT collection contract addresses.               |
| Metadata Manager            | Allow certain dApps to store some user settings related to the dApp under the Universal Profile's storage, and allow each specific dApp to update these specific data only.                                                                                                           | `SETDATA` + Allowed ERC725Y Data Keys                                                                                                            |
| Universal Receiver Delegate | Allow your Universal Receiver Delegate to operate automatically when receiving tokens or NFTs (_e.g: add / remove them in your received assets, automatically transfer a certain percentage of tokens received into a saving vault, save certain valuable NFTs into a vault, etc..._) |                                                                                                                                                  |

| Automated Trading           | Allow a defi protocol to automatically transfer certain tokens automatically on your behalf for trading purpose                                                                                                                                                                       | `CALL` + Allowed Calls on certain token addresses.                                                                                               |

Using the Key Manager's permissions for a Universal Profile enables to catalyze interactions on the blockchain. Instead of requiring the main profile owner to have to do _"everything by himself / herself"_ and perform any single actions, any permissioned addresses (trusted users, dapps, smart contracts behind protocols, third party services) can perform the action themselves in a restricted manner, without having to wait for the user to complete the action.

## Allowed ERC725Y Data Keys

:::note

If controller has `SETDATA` permission but has no `AllowedERC725YDataKeys`, controller will not be able to use the `SETDATA` permission at all.

:::

Key Manager allows for restricting controller addresses to change only specific or dynamic data keys. In order to achieve such functionality:

1. encode a set of data keys as [`bytes[CompactBytesArray]`](https://github.com/lukso-network/LIPs/blob/main/LSPs/LSP-2-ERC725YJSONSchema.md#bytescompactbytesarray)
2. store them under the data key [`AllowedERC725YDataKeys`](/standards/access-control/lsp6-key-manager.md#allowed-erc725y-data-keys).

### Specific Data Keys

A _Specific Data Key_ must have the length of 32 bytes. Setting a _Specific Data Key_ in the [Allowed ERC725Y Data Keys](/standards/access-control/lsp6-key-manager.md#allowed-erc725y-data-keys) will allow the controller to only modify the data value of that _Specific Data Key_.

### Dynamic Data Keys

A _Dynamic Data Key_ can have any length between 0 and 32 (except 0 and 32). Setting a _Dynamic Data Key_ in the [Allowed ERC725Y Data Keys](/standards/access-control/lsp6-key-manager.md#allowed-erc725y-data-keys) will allow the controller to modify the data value of any data key that starts exactly with that _Dynamic Data Key_.

Example:

Dynamic Data Key - `0xcafe0000cafe0000beef0000beef`

| Data key                                                             | Can modify data value? |
| :------------------------------------------------------------------- | :--------------------- |
| `0xcafe0000cafe0000beef0000beef000000000000000000000000000000000000` | ‚úÖ                     |
| `0xcafe0000cafe0000beef0000beef000000000000000000000000000000000123` | ‚úÖ                     |
| `0xcafe0000cafe0000beef0000beefcafecafecafecafecafecafecafecafecafe` | ‚úÖ                     |
| `0x0000000000000000000000000000cafecafecafecafecafecafecafecafecafe` | ‚ùå                     |
| `0x000000000000000000000000000000000000cafe0000cafe0000beef0000beef` | ‚ùå                     |

## Allowed Calls

:::note

If controller has `CALL` permission but has no `AllowedCalls`, controller will not be able to use the `CALL` permission at all.

:::

Key Manager allows for restricting controller addresses to be able to call specific functions on specific addresses which should be of a specific standard. In order to achieve such functionality one could encode a set of type calls, addresses, standards and functions to [`bytes[CompactBytesArray]`](https://github.com/lukso-network/LIPs/blob/main/LSPs/LSP-2-ERC725YJSONSchema.md#bytesncompactbytesarray), and store them under the [Allowed Calls](../../standards/access-control/lsp6-key-manager.md#allowed-calls) data key.

_E.g._

Supposedly we have the following `AllowedCalls`:
`0x002000000002cafecafecafecafecafecafecafecafecafecafe24871b3d7f23690c002000000003cafecafecafecafecafecafecafecafecafecafe24871b3d44c028fe`

It can be decoded as:

| Allowed Calls       |                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             |                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              |
| :------------------ | :------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ | :--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| First allowed call  | **Call Types** - `0x00000002` (Call) <br/> **Address** - `0xcafecafecafecafecafecafecafecafecafecafe` <br/> **Standard** - `0x24871b3d` (LSP0) <br/> **Function** - `0x7f23690c` (`setData(bytes32,bytes)`)                                 | - This allowed call permits the controller to use the function `setData(bytes32,bytes)` in the contract deployed at address `0xcafecafecafecafecafecafecafecafecafecafe`. <br/> - When calling that function the operation type has to be `CALL` with no value being sent. <br/> - The address `0xcafecafecafecafecafecafecafecafecafecafe` has to return true to `ERC165.supportsInterface(0x24871b3d)`.                    |
| Second allowed call | **Call Types** - `0x00000003` (Transfervalue & Call) <br/> **Address** - `0xcafecafecafecafecafecafecafecafecafecafe` <br/> **Standard** - `0x24871b3d` (LSP0) <br/> **Function** - `0x44c028fe` (`execute(uint256,address,uint256,bytes)`) | - This allowed call permits the controller to use the function `execute(uint256,address,uint256,bytes)` in the contract deployed at address `0xcafecafecafecafecafecafecafecafecafecafe`. <br/> - When calling that function the operation type has to be `CALL`, you can send value as well. <br/> - The address `0xcafecafecafecafecafecafecafecafecafecafe` has to return true to `ERC165.supportsInterface(0x24871b3d)`. |

## Implement custom permissions

> **Note:** although custom permissions can be created, this might not prevent from collisions where third party applications may treat the same custom permission differently.

The permission system of the Key Manager is versatile enough to allow new custom permissions to be created, for specific application use cases, aside from the default ones. Since the permissions use `bytes32` as type, the range is large enough to fit up to 256 permissions in total ([32 bytes = 256 bits](../../standards/access-control/lsp6-key-manager#address-permissions)).

For instance, data stored under some data keys could be very sensitive for some specific dApp (_e.g: represent the :up: user settings for this dApp._), and a developer might not necessarily want to use the **Allowed ERC725Y Data Keys** for this particular data key.

The Solidity implementation of the Key Manager allows extend the verification logic to [implement custom permissions](https://github.com/lukso-network/lsp-smart-contracts/blob/8f0cfb2c573c44702d3155375b2d935b043416b3/contracts/LSP6KeyManager/LSP6Modules/LSP6SetDataModule.sol#L263-L275). This can be done by simply overriding some of the functions that check for permissions depending on the action being performed (the action being defined by the calldata sent and the function being called, like `setData(...)`, `execute(...)`, etc...).

Below is a Solidity example of a custom Key Manager that can control a token contract and requires a specific permission to update the `LSP4Metadata`.

            controllerPermissions.hasPermission(
                _PERMISSION_UPDATE_TOKEN_METADATA
            );
        }

        super._getPermissionRequiredToSetDataKey(
            controlledContract,
            controllerPermissions,
            inputDataKey,
            inputDataValue
        );
    }

}
```

As you can see from the Solidity code snippet above, since the Key Manager is broken down in multiple modules for each set of permissions related to specific type of actions (`LSP6SetDataModule`, `LSP6OwnershipModule`), it is relatively easy to create a specific implementation by-reusing the same code and implement custom permissions check on top based on the examples above.
