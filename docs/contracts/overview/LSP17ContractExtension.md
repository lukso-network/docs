# Extendable & Extension Contracts

Contracts that use the LSP17 standard are called **Extendable Contracts**. Meaning they can extend their functionalities by linking **Extension Contracts** to them for specific functionalities that they do not support natively.


## Extendable Contracts

The list of extensions for specific functions are stored under the specific data keys under their ERC725Y storage. You can think of them as **Extension Hosts**.

You can inherit the [`LSP17Extendable.sol`](../contracts/LSP17ContractExtension/LSP17Extendable.md) contract to create an extendable contract.

:::warning

Be aware that adding an extension that can `selfdestruct` itself can be dangerous. This can make the [`LSP17Extendable`](../contracts/LSP17ContractExtension/LSP17Extendable.md) contract vulnerable to [metamorphic contracts](https://twitter.com/samczsun/status/1660012956632104960).

If this extension contract has been deployed at a pre-determined address with `CREATE2`, an attacker could `selfdestruct` it and deploy a new one with different runtime bytecode using `CREATE2` and the same salt and initialization code as on the first deployment. 

This can result in the new contract to have the same address but different functionality. An attacker can now use these new functionalities to perform malicious actions.

### Forwarding native tokens received to extensions

The [`LSP17Extendable`](../contracts/LSP17ContractExtension/LSP17Extendable.md) contract implementation does not forward by default the native tokens received by the contract to the extension contract.

If you want your extension to receive native tokens, by forwarding them to the extension contract (for instance, for extensions that require native tokens as part of their logic, or to make the extendable contract to fully work as a _"proxy forwarder contract"_), you can override the [`_fallbackLSP17Extendable`](../contracts/LSP17ContractExtension/LSP17Extendable.md#_fallbacklsp17extendable) function.




## Extensions Contracts

Extension contracts are contracts deployed on the network that aim to be used for extending functionalities that use the LSP17 standard.

You can inherit the [`LSP17Extendable.sol`](../contracts/LSP17ContractExtension/LSP17Extendable.md) contract to create a contract extension.

:::warning

The extendable contract might forward the value that it received on extension call. 

If the extension you are creating is not intended to receive value, make sure to revert by adding a simple check:

```solidity
if (msg.value == 0) revert(...)
``` 

**If your extension does not have a way to withdraw the native tokens, they will be stuck in the contract**.

:::

### Checking the amount of native tokens received by the extended contract

You can use the function [`_extendableMsgValue()`](../contracts/LSP17ContractExtension/LSP17Extension.md#_extendablemsgvalue) function to check the amount of native tokens received by the extended contract in the first place.

This function can be useful if you want to create a behaviour in your extension contract that takes into account that the `msg.value` received. For instance:

- your extended contract received a specific amount of native tokens (_e.g: `_extendableMsgValue() == 1 ether`_).
- your extended contract did not receive any native tokens at all (_e.g: `_extendableMsgValue() == 0`_).
