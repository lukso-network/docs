# Execute Relay Call

## Validity timestamps

:::info

Use this website to generate validity timestamps for specific date and time.

:::

It is possible to make signatures for relay executions valid for specific time periods. This is done by constructing a **validity timestamp** that can be passed as the `uint256 validityTimestamp` parameter to `executeRelayCall` and `executeRelayCallBatch` functions. 

Below are examples of constructing different **validity timestamps**:

### Example 1: from a specific date / time

Valid only from the 1st June 2024 (midnight).

Timestamp for _1st June 2024_ = `1717200000` (decimal) = `0x665A6480` (hex) 

```
   valid from timestamp 1717200000
  vvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvv
0x000000000000000000000000665A648000000000000000000000000000000000
                                  ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
                                      valid until indefinitely
```

### Example 2: set an expiry date

Valid until 31st January 2025, 5pm CET.

Timestamp for _31st January 2025 (5pm CET)_ = `1738339200` (decimal) = `0x679CF380` (hex)


```
         valid from anytime
  vvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvv
0x00000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000679CF380
                                  ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
                                valid until 31st January 2025 (5pm CET)
```

### Example 3: valid during a specific period


Valid from 1st January 2024 (midnight CET) to 1st April 2024 (midnight CET)

- Timestamp for _1st January 2024 (midnight)_ = `1704063600` (decimal) = `0x6591F270` (hex)
- Timestamp for _1st April 2024 (midnight)_ = `1711926000` (decimal) = `0x6609EAF0` (hex)

```
            valid from 
  vvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvv
0x0000000000000000000000006591F2700000000000000000000000006609EAF0
                                  ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
                                             valid until
```
