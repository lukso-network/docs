# LSP7 Digital Asset

The **DigitalAsset** contract represents digital assets, for either fungible or non-fungible tokens where minting and transfering is specified with an amount of tokens. It have some functions from **[ERC20](https://github.com/OpenZeppelin/openzeppelin-contracts/blob/master/contracts/token/ERC20/ERC20.sol)** and **[ERC777](https://github.com/OpenZeppelin/openzeppelin-contracts/blob/master/contracts/token/ERC777/ERC777.sol)** with more upgraded features.

This contract serves as a **Fungible Token Contract** when  `isNFT`  bool is set to `false` in the constructor, and serves as **Non-Fungible Token Contract** otherwise. 

:::note
**_DigitalAsset implementation also contains the methods from [ERC165](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-165) and [ERC725Y](https://github.com/ethereum/EIPs/blob/master/EIPS/eip-725.md#erc725y) contract to attach metadata to the asset._**

## Functions


### decimals

```solidity
  function decimals() public view returns (uint256 value)
```

Returns the number of decimals used to get its user representation.

If the contract represents a **NFT** then `0`  **SHOULD** be used, otherwise `18` is the common value.
